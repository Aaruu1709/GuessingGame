### Steps to Play the Guessing Game:

1. **Enter Your Guess**: Think of a number within the specified range and enter it in the input field.
2. **Receive Feedback**: After each guess, the game will tell you if your number is too high or too low.
3. **Keep Trying**: You have a limited number of attempts, so keep guessing based on the hints until you find the correct number or run out of tries.
4. **Celebrate or Try Again**: If you guess the correct number, you'll see a celebration message. If not, the game ends, and you can try again!
